We will use the [Phylonco](https://github.com/bioDS/beast-phylonco) project as an example
to demonstrate how to implement a LPhy or LPhyBEAST extension. 



## Project structure

The extension project supposes to contain 3 modules, also known as sub-projects in Gradle. 
They are located in the subfolders under the project root folder. 

1. `beast2` contains the BEAST 2 classes;
2. `lphy` contains LPhy extension classes; 
3. `lphybeast` contains the mapping classes between BEAST 2 and LPhy.

The project folder structure looks like:
