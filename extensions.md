1. Go to the releases page of the extension, e.g., [Phylonco releases](https://github.com/bioDS/beast-phylonco/releases)

2. Download the jar with the prefix `-lphy-(version number).jar`, for example [phylonco-lphy-0.0.3.jar](https://github.com/bioDS/beast-phylonco/releases/download/v1.0.0/phylonco-lphy-0.0.3.jar)

3. Place the jar inside the `lib` subdirectory of your LPhy installation

Your directory structure should look like this:
