# LinguaPhylo: Communicating and reproducing probabilistic models for phylogenetic analysis

A new paradigm for scientific computing and data science has begun to emerged in the last decade. 
A recent example is the publication of the first "computationally reproducible article" using eLife's 
Reproducible Document Stack which blends features of a traditional manuscript with live code, data and interactive figures.

Although standard tools for statistical phylogenetics provide a degree of reproducibility and 
reusability through popular open-source software and computer-readable data file formats, there is still much to do. 
The ability to construct and accurately communicate probabilistic models in phylogenetics is frustratingly underdeveloped. 
There is low interoperability between different inference packages (e.g. BEAST1, BEAST2, MrBayes, RevBayes), 
and the file formats that these software use have low readability for researchers.

This repository contains two related projects: LinguaPhylo (LPhy for short) and LPhyBEAST.
