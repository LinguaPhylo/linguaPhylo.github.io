LPhy and LPhyBEAST are developed based on Java 16,
which is the latest long-term support (LTS) version.
The LPhy extension mechanism is implemented using
the Service Provider Interface (SPI) and the Java Platform Module System (JPMS). 

All LPhy related projects are now published to the
[Maven central repo](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.github.linguaphylo).
