This tutorial is modified from Taming the BEAST tutorial [Time-stamped data](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/MEP-tutorial/).

## Requirements

The programs used in this tutorial are listed [below](#programs-used-in-this-exercise).
In case you have not done it yet, please follow the installation
instructions [here]() before moving on.

## Background

In this tutorial, we will study the __phylodynamics of the Respiratory
syncytial virus subgroup A (RSVA)__.
RSVA infects the human lower respiratory tract, causing symptoms that
are often indistinguishable from the common cold.
By age 3, nearly all children will be infected, and a small percentage
(<3%) will develop a more serious inflammation of the bronchioles
requiring hospitalisation.

## Goals

The goal of our phylodynamic analysis is to estimate:

* the rate of molecular evolution (of RSVA's G gene);
* the date of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all viral
  samples (i.e., the tree's __root__), interpreted as the first
  infection event with respect to the samples at hand; 
* the phylogenetic relationships among viral samples.

## Data

Our data is comprised of 129 molecular sequences coding for RSVA's G
protein ([Zlateva et al., 2004; Zlateva et al., 2005](#references), a
glycoprotein that allows the virus to attach itself to the host cells'
membranes, starting the infection.
Importantly, our data is __time stamped__ (also referred to as
__heterochronous__ or __serial__ data) because it was collected at
multiple time points, from 1956--2002.

Below we further detail how we will treat our molecular data in our
analyses.

### The NEXUS alignment

{% include_relative download-data.md df='RSV2' df_link='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompEvol/beast2/master/examples/nexus/RSV2.nex' %}

This .nex file can also be found in the ```examples/nexus``` folder,
where BEAST 2 was installed.

#### Multiple partitions

Our molecular alignment corresponds to a 629-bp coding sequence of
RSVA's G protein.
We are going to partition our alignment into three compartments
corresponding to the first, second and third codon positions.

### Tip dates

{% include_relative tip-dates-forward.md  earliest='the 1950s' 
                    date_in_name='after the last lower-case `s`' 
                    since='1900' regex='s(\d+)$' last='2002' %}

## Constructing the scripts in LPhy Studio

{% include_relative lphy-scripts.md %}

### Data block

{% include_relative lphy-data.md %}

Our data here consist of molecular alignments and the sample dates.

We start by parsing the latter with regular expression `"{{
include.regex }}"`, which extracts the sample dates from the NEXUS
file, converting them to ages in __forward__ time (i.e., the root age
is 0.0).

{% include_relative age-direction.md %}

Then we must parse the molecular alignments.
Note that our open reading frame (ORF) starts in position 3, which
must be reflected by the arguments with pass on to the `charset()`
function: first (`"3-629\3"`), second (`"1-629\3"`) and third
(`"2-629\3"`) codon positions.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include_relative time-stamped-data/lphy_datablock.html %}
{:/}

If the setup is correct, the most recent sequences (i.e., {{
include.last }}) should have an `Age` of 0.0, while all other tips
should be > 0.0.

### Model block

{% include_relative lphy-model.md %}

In this analysis, we will use three HKY models with estimated frequencies for each of three partitions, 
and share the strict clock model and a Kingman coalescent tree generative distribution across partitions. 
But we are also interested about the relative substitution rate for each of three partitions.

So, we define the priors for the following parameters:
1. the effective population size _Î˜_;  
2. the general clock rate _clockRate_;
3. the relative substitution rates _mu_ which has 3 dimensions;
4. the transition/transversion ratio _kappa_ which also has 3 dimensions;
5. the base frequencies _pi_. 

The script `n=length(codon);` is equivalent to `n=3;`, since `codon` is a 3-partition alignment.
Here `rep(element=1.0, times=n)` will create an array of `n` 1.0, which is `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`.

The benefit of using 3 relative substitution rates here instead of 3 clock rates is that we could use the DeltaExchangeOperator
to these relative rates in the MCMC sampling to help the converagence.

Please note the tree here is already the time tree, the age direction will have been processed in `data` block.

## Analysing the BEAST output

Note that the effective sample sizes (ESSs) for many of the logged quantities are small 
(ESSs less than 100 will be highlighted in red by Tracer). This is not good. 
A low ESS means that the trace contains a lot of correlated samples and thus may not represent the posterior distribution well. 
In the bottom right of the window is a frequency plot of the samples which is expected given the low ESSs is extremely rough.

If we select the tab on the right-hand-side labelled Trace we can view the raw trace, that is, 
the sampled values against the step in the MCMC chain.

<figure class="image">
  <img src="short.png" alt="The trace of short run">
  <figcaption>Figure 3: A screenshot of Tracer.</figcaption>
</figure>


Here you can see how the samples are correlated. 
The default chain length of the MCMC is 1,000,000 in `LPhyBEAST`.
There are 1800 samples in the trace after removing 10% burnin (we ran the MCMC for steps sampling every 500) 
but adjacent samples often tend to have similar values. 
The ESS for the absolute rate of evolution (clockRate) is about 17 so we are only getting 1 independent sample 
to every 105 ~ 1800/17 actual samples). With a short run such as this one, 
it may also be the case that the default burn-in of 10% of the chain length is inadequate. 
Not excluding enough of the start of the chain as burn-in will render estimates of ESS unreliable.

The simple response to this situation is that we need to run the chain for longer. 
So letâ€™s go for a chain length of 15,000,000 but keep logging the same number of samples (2,000). 

Question: what is the logging frequency (logEvery) now?


You could run `LPhyBEAST` with the `-l` argument again to create a new XML:

```
java -jar LPhyBEAST.jar -l 15000000 -o RSV2long.xml RSV2.lphy
```

or manually edit the XML at the following lines:

```
<run id="MCMC" spec="MCMC" chainLength="15000000" preBurnin="1480">

<logger id="Logger" spec="Logger" logEvery="750000">

<logger id="Logger1" spec="Logger" fileName="RSV2long.log" logEvery="7500">

<logger id="psi.treeLogger" spec="Logger" fileName="RSV2long.trees" logEvery="7500">
```

Now run BEAST and load the new log file into Tracer (you can leave the old one loaded for comparison).

Click on the Trace tab and look at the raw trace plot.

<figure class="image">
  <img src="long.png" alt="The trace of long run">
  <figcaption>Figure 4: A screenshot of Tracer.</figcaption>
</figure>

After running the analysis long enough in MCMC, we have the 1800 samples after removing 10% burnin, 
but with an ESS of each estimated parameter > 200. 
There is still auto-correlation between the samples, 
but > 200 effectively independent samples will now provide a very good estimate of the posterior distribution. 
There are no obvious trends in the plot which would suggest that the MCMC has not yet converged, 
and there are no significant long range fluctuations in the trace which would suggest poor mixing.

As we are satisfied with the mixing we can now move on to one of the parameters of interest: substitution rate. 
Select clockRate in the left-hand table. This is the average substitution rate across all sites in the alignment. 
Now choose the density plot by selecting the tab labeled Marginal Density. 
This shows a plot of the marginal posterior probability density of this parameter. 
You should see a plot similar to this:

<figure class="image">
  <img src="clockRate.png" alt="marginal density">
  <figcaption>Figure 5: The marginal density in Tracer.</figcaption>
</figure>


As you can see the posterior probability density is roughly bell-shaped. 
There is some sampling noise which would be reduced if we ran the chain for longer or 
sampled more often but we already have a good estimate of the mean and HPD interval. 
You can overlay the density plots of multiple traces in order to compare them 
(it is up to the user to determine whether they are comparable on the the same axis or not). 
Select the relative substitution rates for all three codon positions in the table to the left 
(labelled mu.0, mu.1 and mu.2). 
You will now see the posterior probability densities for the relative substitution rate at all three codon positions overlaid:

## Summarising the trees

{% include_relative tree-annotator.md fignum="Figure 7" %}


Summary trees can be viewed using FigTree (a program separate from BEAST) and DensiTree (distributed with BEAST).

In what year did the common ancestor of all RSVA viruses sampled live? What is the 95% HPD?
