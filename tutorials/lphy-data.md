The LPhy data block is used to input and store the data, 
which will be processed by the models defined later, 
and which also allows you to reuse the another dataset 
by simply replacing the current data. 

In this block, we normally include the constants for models, 
the alignment loaded from a NEXUS file, 
and the meta data regarding to the information of taxa that we have known.

Please make sure the tab above the command console is set to `data`, 
and type or copy and paste the data block scripts into the console.
