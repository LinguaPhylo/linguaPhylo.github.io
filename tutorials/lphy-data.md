The LPhy data block is used to input and store the data, 
which will be processed by the models defined later. 
The data concepts here include the alignment loaded from a NEXUS file, 
and the meta data regarding to the information of taxa that we have known. 

Please make sure the tab above the command console is set to `data`, 
and type or copy and paste the following scripts into the console.
When you write your LPhy scripts, please be aware that `data` and `model` 
have been reserved and cannot be used as the variable name.
