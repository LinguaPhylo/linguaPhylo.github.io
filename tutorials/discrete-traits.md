For this analyses we have additional information about 
the sampling location of sequences taken from patients,
which are including {{ include.locations }}.
We can extract these sampling locations from taxa labels, 
using {{ include.using }} 
where `i` is the index of split elements and starting from 0. 
You can check them by clicking the graphical component `{{ include.traits }}` (yellow orange diamond)
generated by the `data` section.
