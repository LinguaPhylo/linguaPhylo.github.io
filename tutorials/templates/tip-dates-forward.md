In phylodynamic and macroevolutionary analyses, quite often our
samples (viral sequences from infected individuals in the 
former case and from different species in the latter, for
example) were collected only at the present moment.
In such cases we assign our samples a date of 0.0 to
represent the present -- this is our default.

As mentioned above, however, our sequences have been sampled at
various dates going back to {{ include.earliest }}.
We can see the date of each of our samples (sequences) in the NEXUS
file, {{ include.date_in_name }}.
This date can be read as years since {{ include.since }}.
