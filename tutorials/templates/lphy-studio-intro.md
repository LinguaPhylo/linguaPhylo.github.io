To get started, [launch LPhy Studio](https://linguaphylo.github.io/setup/#launching-lphy-studio). 
To load the script into LPhy Studio, click on the `File` menu and hover your mouse over `Tutorial scripts`. 
A child menu will appear on the left side, and then select the script {{include.script}}.

The probabilistic graphical model will be visualised on the left panel.
By clicking on the graphical components, you can view their current values 
displayed in the right-side panel titled `Current`.
You can also switch the view to show the script after clicking on the tab `Model`. 
The next tab, `Narrative`, will display an auto-generated narrative 
using natural language to describe the models with citations. 
This narrative can serve as the foundation for manuscript method sections. 

If you are not familiar with LPhy language, we recommend reading the 
[language features](https://linguaphylo.github.io/features/) before getting started.
