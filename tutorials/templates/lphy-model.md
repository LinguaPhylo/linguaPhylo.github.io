The `model { ... }` block is the main protagonist of our scripts.
This is where you will specify the many nodes and sampling
distributions that characterize a probabilistic model.

(Note that keyword `model` cannot be used to name variables because it
is reserved for defining scripting blocks as outlined above.)

In order to start specifying the ``model { ... }` block, make sure you
type into the "model" tab of the command prompt, by clicking "model"
at the bottom of LPhy Studio's window.
