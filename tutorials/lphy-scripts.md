LPhy Studio implements a GUI for users to specify and visualize
probabilistic graphical models, as well as for simulating data 
under those models.
These tasks are executed according to an LPhy script the user types
(or loads) on LPhy Studio's interactive terminal.

Below, we will build an LPhy script in two parts, the `data` and
the `model` blocks.
