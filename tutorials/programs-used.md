The following software will be used in this tutorial:

* LPhyBEAST - this software will construct an input file for BEAST
* BEAST - this package contains the BEAST program, BEAUti, DensiTree, TreeAnnotator and other utility programs. 
  This tutorial is written for BEAST v2.6.x, which has support for multiple partitions. 
  It is available for download from [http://www.beast2.org](http://www.beast2.org).
* BEAST outercore package - this package of BEAST 2 has core features, but not in the core.
  You can install and use it following the instruction of [managing BEAST 2 packages](http://www.beast2.org/managing-packages/).
* BEAST labs package - containing some generally useful stuff used by other packages.
* BEAST [feast](https://github.com/tgvaughan/feast) package - this is a small BEAST 2 package 
  which contains additions to the core functionality. 
* Tracer - this program is used to explore the output of BEAST (and other Bayesian MCMC programs). 
  It graphically and quantitively summarises the distributions of continuous parameters and provides diagnostic information. 
  At the time of writing, the current version is v1.7. It is available for download from [http://beast.community/tracer](http://beast.community/tracer).
* FigTree - this is an application for displaying and printing molecular phylogenies, in particular those obtained using BEAST. 
  At the time of writing, the current version is v1.4.3. It is available for download from [http://beast.community/figtree](http://beast.community/figtree).
